# Token Association Fix Summary

## Problem
Users were getting `INVALID_SIGNATURE` errors when trying to buy shares or receiving tokens after asset creation. This was caused by Hedera's requirement that accounts must explicitly associate with tokens before they can receive them.

## Root Causes
1. **Share Purchase Flow**: The buy flow attempted to transfer tokens without checking if the recipient account was associated with the token first
2. **Asset Creation Flow**: Server-side token transfers to creator account failed because the creator hadn't associated with the newly created tokens
3. **HashPack Wallet Behavior**: The association modal would appear but clicking "Associate" wouldn't complete the transaction

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Token Association Check (hedera.ts)
Added `checkTokenAssociations()` function to query account's token relationships:
- Uses `AccountInfoQuery` to get account info
- Iterates through `tokenRelationships` Map to find associated tokens
- Returns object mapping tokenId to boolean (true if associated)

### 2. Token Association Composer (hedera.ts)
Enhanced `composeTokenAssociation()` function:
- Accepts array of tokenIds for batch association
- Generates TransactionId from user's account (required for user-signed txs)
- Returns base64-encoded transaction bytes for wallet signing

### 3. Updated Token Association API (app/api/rpc/compose/token-associate/route.ts)
- Now supports both old format (`tokenId`, `account`) and new format (`tokenIds`, `accountId`)
- Uses the shared `composeTokenAssociation()` helper
- Added enhanced logging for debugging

### 4. Token Association Check API (app/api/rpc/check-token-association/route.ts)
- New endpoint to check which tokens an account is associated with
- Takes `accountId` and `tokenIds` array
- Returns object with association status for each token

### 5. Enhanced Share Purchase Flow (app/asset/[id]/page.tsx)
The buy function now follows a multi-step process:
1. **Check Association**: Calls `/api/rpc/check-token-association` to verify token association
2. **Associate if Needed**: If token not associated, composes association transaction and prompts user to sign
3. **Transfer Tokens**: After successful association (or if already associated), proceeds with token transfer

### 6. NFT Transfer Composer (hedera.ts)
Added `composeNftTransfer()` function for client-side NFT transfers:
- Similar to `composeFtTransfer()` but for NFTs
- Takes tokenId, serialNumber, sender, recipient
- Can be used for future claim functionality

## Testing Steps

### Test Share Purchase Flow
1. Connect wallet (HashPack extension)
2. Navigate to an asset detail page
3. Click "Buy Shares"
4. **First Time**: 
   - You'll see "Associating token with your account..." message
   - HashPack will prompt to sign association transaction
   - After signing, association completes
   - System waits 2 seconds for network propagation
   - Then prompts to sign the actual share transfer
5. **Subsequent Purchases**:
   - Token already associated, skips step 4
   - Directly prompts for share transfer signature

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ No more "INVALID_SIGNATURE" errors
- ✅ Clear status messages during each step
- ✅ Toast notifications for user feedback
- ✅ Association happens automatically before first purchase
- ✅ Subsequent purchases skip association step

## Known Issues & Future Work

### Asset Creation Token Transfers
- Server cannot sign transactions for user accounts
- Current behavior: Asset creation attempts transfers, logs failures
- **Workaround**: Added warning notice on create page
- **Future Fix**: Implement claim flow where users:
  1. Create asset (server-side)
  2. Associate tokens (client-side wallet signature)
  3. Claim tokens via dedicated claim endpoint

### Recommended Enhancements
1. **Batch Association**: Allow associating both NFT and FT in single transaction during asset creation
2. **Claim Interface**: Add "Claim Tokens" button on asset page for creators
3. **Association Status UI**: Show which tokens user is associated with
4. **Auto-Refresh**: Refresh asset data after successful purchases

## API Changes

### New Endpoints
- `POST /api/rpc/check-token-association`
  - Request: `{ accountId: string, tokenIds: string[] }`
  - Response: `{ ok: boolean, associations: Record<string, boolean> }`

### Updated Endpoints
- `POST /api/rpc/compose/token-associate`
  - Now accepts: `{ accountId: string, tokenIds: string[] }` (new format)
  - Still supports: `{ account: string, tokenId: string }` (legacy format)
  - Response: `{ ok: boolean, bytes: string, transactionId: string }`

## Files Modified
1. `fullstack/lib/hedera.ts` - Added association check and compose functions
2. `fullstack/app/asset/[id]/page.tsx` - Enhanced buy flow with association logic
3. `fullstack/app/api/rpc/compose/token-associate/route.ts` - Updated to use shared helper
4. `fullstack/app/api/rpc/check-token-association/route.ts` - New endpoint for checking associations
5. `fullstack/app/create/page.tsx` - Added warning notice about token association

## Deployment Notes
- No environment variable changes required
- No database schema changes
- Backward compatible with existing token associations
- Users with already-associated tokens will see no change in behavior
